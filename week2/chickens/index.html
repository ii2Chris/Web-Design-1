    <p>
      The <b>Chicken</b> is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated
      from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most
      chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as
      pets or for cockfighting.

    <p>
      Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the
      legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild
      junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
      allow them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary
      widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy
      crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin
      on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are
      more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra
      feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.
